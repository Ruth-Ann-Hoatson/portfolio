Hello there, 
Welcome to my portfolio. 

I am excited to walk you through my very first website I've made from scratch.
Even though this project is very simple to understand, I will add a few notes to this
document in order for you to understand it entirely.

The main page is named app.html.From this page, the links to the other page will be found in 
the navigation bar(located on the far right).

Navigation Links Include:
Course Work - course.html - Course work that I have done within my Bachelor Of Arts in Corporate Communications degree.
Work Experience - work.html - Work experience  that I have done.
Certifications - cert.html - Certifications that I have.
About - about.html - This includes my skills and a bit more about who I am.

Direct links to My: 
Reference page
Email
LinkedIn 
Ghithub

These Links have been included on the bottom right of the main app.html page.

I have made use of a few online platforms for this project which include:
Bootstrap 4 
Bulma 
Google Fonts 
Font Awesome 

The app.css is my own stylesheet which is linked to each of the pages.

The app.js is the javascript that shows the basic javascript that I have learnt
over a short space of time. For this project, I simply made use of javaScript to 
change the colour of  the text on the main app.html page when the 'click me' button is 
pressed.

Thank you and Enjoy!
